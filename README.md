# Trainee-project-Am-I-good-pet-owner-0.2
A simple prototype of a game quiz helping to know animals better - in several variants.

This tiny tutorial project is a game test that can interact with the user at the console version.

Answer the questions - enter the appropriate numbers and at the end of the game you will understand
whether you know dogs well and are you ready to become the owner of a pet.

For a beginner developer, the project in various versions of the code demonstrates the possibilities
of using the main elements of OOP, helps to refresh and train knowledge.

The project was created as part of an internship - learning a new language Swift.
Now I'm working on UI design and developing a more interesting game based on this one.
